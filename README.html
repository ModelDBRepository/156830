Multiscale model of AngII signaling and membrane electrophysiology

We developed a novel multiscale model to bridge neuropeptide
receptor-activated signaling pathway with membrane electrophysiology.
The model studies the effects of Angiotensin II (AngII) on neuronal
excitability changes mediated by signaling dynamics and downstream
phosphorylation of ion channels. The multiscale model was implemented
as a set of ordinary differential equations solved using the ode15s
solver in Matlab (Mathworks, USA). The signaling reactions were
modeled with either mass-action or Michaelis--Menten kinetics and ion
channel electrophysiology was modeled according to the Hodgkin-Huxley
formalism. These models were initially validated against their
respective data domains independently and were integrated to develop a
multiscale model of signaling and electrophysiology.

Model was initially developed by Dirk Fey. Multiple modifications were
made by Hiren Makadia and Warren Anderson. This model was developed at
Dr. Raj Vadigepalli Lab, Daniel Baugh Institute for Functional
Genomics and Computational Biology, Thomas Jefferson University,
Philadelphia PA 19107. This file was written by Hiren Makadia on 8th
Jan 2015.
